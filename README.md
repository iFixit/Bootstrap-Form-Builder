#Bootstrap Form Builder

##What's this?

A Drag-and-drop form builder for [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). 

This fork includes saving and loading functionality, but it will only work within
the context of a Dozuki Guide Edit page with the data capture feature enabled.
The code is presented as an example of how saving and loading could be implemented.

See [the original](https://github.com/minikomi/Bootstrap-Form-Builder) for full docs.
